# Conductor

Simple package for **api** authorization.

## When is this package good?

* when you need to restrict access to most endpoints when exposing some to third party developers
* when you don't want to spam your controllers with plugs for every action
* when you must respond according to existing permission system (e.g. scopes in jwt)

## When is this package not good?

* when you need authentication
* when you need authorization for html pages
* when you need advanced permissions management system

## Installation

```elixir
def deps do
  [{:conductor, "~> 0.2.0"}]
end
```

## Conductor macro
Basically, this:

```elixir
defmodule Controller do
  use Conductor
  use Phoenix.Controller

  def index(conn, _params),  do: #...

  def show(conn, _params),   do: #...

  @authorize scope: "scope1"
  def create(conn, _params)  do: #...

  @authorize scope: "scope2"
  def delete(conn, _params), do: #...
end
```

will be compiled to this:

```elixir
defmodule Controller do
  use Conductor
  use Phoenix.Controller

  plug Conductor.Plugs.Authorize, ["scope1"] when action in [:create]
  plug Conductor.Plugs.Authorize, ["scope2"] when action in [:delete]
  plug Conductor.Plugs.Authorize, [] when not action in [:create, :delete]

  def index(conn, _params),  do: #...
  def show(conn, _params),   do: #...
  def create(conn, _params), do: #...
  def delete(conn, _params), do: #...
end
```

## Root scope

You can register scope that will have full access everywhere

```elixir
  config :conductor,
    root_scopes: ["admin"]
```

## Adding scopes

```elixir
  conn |> Plug.Conn.assign(:scopes, ["scope1, scope2"])
```

## Public access

```elixir
defmodule Router do
  pipeline :public do
    plug Conductor.Plugs.SkipAuthorization
  end

  scope "/public", MyApp do
    pipe_through [:public]

    get "/something", SomethingController, :something
  end
end
```

## Authorization failures

To avoid confusion with random `403` response codes that come from nowhere, Conductor will raise error on authorization failure as default.

This can be changed by following config

```elixir
  config :conductor,
    on_auth_failure: :send_resp
```

## Example

```elixir
  #config
  config :conductor,
    root_scopes: ["root_scope"],
    on_auth_error: :send_resp

  #router
  pipeline :public do
    plug Conductor.Plugs.SkipAuthorization
  end

  scope "/", Example do
    get "/1", Controller, :action1
    get "/3", Controller, :action3
    get "/4", Controller, :action4
  end

  scope "/", Example do
    pipe_through [:public]

    get "/2", Controller, :action2
  end

  #conns
  conn1 = Phoenix.ConnTest.build_conn()
  conn2 = conn1 |> Plug.Conn.assign(:scopes, ["scope1", "scope2"])
  conn3 = conn1 |> Plug.Conn.assign(:scopes, ["root_scope"])

  #endpoints
  @authorize scope: "scope1"
  def action1(conn, _params), do: conn |> send_resp(200, "")

  @authorize scope: "scope2"
  def action2(conn, _params), do: conn |> send_resp(200, "")

  def action3(conn, _params), do: conn |> send_resp(200, "")

  @authorize scopes: ["other", "unused"]
  def action4(conn, _params), do: conn |> send_resp(200, "")
```

|         | conn1 | conn2 | conn3 |
|---------| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| action1 | 403   | 200   | 200   |
| action2 | 200   | 200   | 200   |
| action3 | 403   | 403   | 200   |
| action4 | 403   | 403   | 200   |
